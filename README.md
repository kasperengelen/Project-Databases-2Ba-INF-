# Programming Project Databases

In this repository you will find the code that was written for the course "Programming Project Databases" in the second semester of the 2017-2018 academic year.

In this project we had to create a data-cleaning tool. It supported uploading CSV and SQL files, and then provided tools to do things like find-replace, Z-normalisation, one-hot-encoding, outlier detection, etc. There was also a rollback-system that allowed the user to undo certain operations.

The tool was accessible through the web browser.
