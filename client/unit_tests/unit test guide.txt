This file explains how to add files in the unit test directory of this project
and also include those tests in the TestSuite that test_all.py will run.

STEP 1:

Create your own unit test for the module you coded. Once your unit tests have been written
and run without error you can put them in this directory.

WARNING: If you actually need source files for testing purposes, you should put them in the sources folder.
	 Do not clutter the root directory of the unit_tests.

STEP 2:

Open the test_all.py file and add the necessary lines of code to include your Tests in the TestSuite:

-Import your unit test as the next test. For example "import test_xxx as t3" assuming that t1 and t2 are already imported


-Add the testing class that is in the module you included to the tests = [] list in the main body

- The idea will be clear by looking at already imported tests.

-DO NOT TOUCH ANY OTHER CODE, THAT IS THE ONLY ADDITION YOU NEED TO MAKE FOR THE TESTS TO RUN

-Please check that everything runs, do not push any tests that do not pass.

STEP 3:

If everything runs without fail then you can add the test and push it to the repository.
